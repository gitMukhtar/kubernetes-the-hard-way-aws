# Kubernetes The Hard Way - AWS

This page is based on [Kubernetes The Hard
Way](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way/) guide by Kelsey
Hightower. It compiles AWS CLI commands, mainly from revision
[8185017](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way/tree/818501707e418fc4d6e6aedef8395ca368e3097e)
of the guide (right before AWS support has been removed), with small
adjustments. The original guide provides background and context while this page
contains only the commands. Therefore best is to follow the original guide
side-by-side with this page.

The intent of this page is similar to the original guide. My motivation to
compile it has been to learn more about AWS and Kubernetes.

To keep it somewhat organized, various files generated by this guide's commands
end in the folders below, which is different from the original guide:
- `bin` - for `kubectl` binary
- `tls` - for certificates
- `cfg` - for configuration files
- `ssh` - for SSH private key file
